# Testing 101 For Devs

## Testing is NOT:

* Checking
* A guarantee of bug free
* Only looking for bugs

## Testing IS:

* Exploring
* Good enough quality
* Usability, Accessibility, User Advocacy
* Risk Identification and mitigation

## Testing Vocabulary

* Unit Testing
  - closely coupled to code
  - Isolates section of code to verify its correctness 
* Functional Testing
  - Test against the functional requirements
  - First line of testing
* Smoke Testing
  - Test only the most critical functions of the application
* Sanity Testingquired resources:
  - Test only new functionality
* Regression Testing
  - Test that a recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing features
  
## Software Testing Pyramid

[![Ideal Software Testing Pyramid](https://watirmelon.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/ideal-automated-testing-pyramid.jpg?w=840)](https://watirmelon.blog/testing-pyramids/)

## Testing is About Risk
* Complexity: How hard was it to build? 
* History: Has this broken before?
* Impact: Voice of the customer
* Total Risk: All evaluated to get full picture of risk

## Good Enough Quality
* RisK determines Definition of Done
* DoD changes as project progresses
* Perfect is a Myth

## Test Preparation
* Questions Prior to Testing
  - Introduction
  - What are you testing
  - Applies to:
  - Goal:
  - Required resources:
  - What's out of scope

## Testing with Charters
* Time boxed approach
* Risk Focused
* Session Based
* Invites Exploration
  
## Functional Tests
* Test Script: Step-by-step test instructions
* Test Case: The individual steps

## Automation is Not Always The Answer
* Automate your Repetitive Tasks
* Automate Your Pain Points
* Automation Can't Tell you Everything
